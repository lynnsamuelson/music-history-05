# music-history-05

Nashville Software School next steps in the music history app

##Running the Application

Clone the repo

  mkdir ~/projects && cd ~/projects
  git clone https://github.com/lynnsamuelson/music-history-05.git

##Serve the application

Go to the application root folder and start the server.

    cd ~/projects/music-history
    http-server ./ 

Now you can open your browser and go to http://localhost:8081 (or whichever port it reports it is using) and you should see the basic mock-up. The "More" button will add more songs to the list and you can click a delete button to deltet the song from the DOM (but not the applicatoin).
